        <h1>THE CRITICAL ENGINEER...</h1>
        <div>considers <span>Engineering </span> to be the most transformative language of our time, shaping the way we move, communicate and think. It is the work of the <span>Critical Engineer</span> to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence.</div>
        <div>recognises that each work of <span>engineering</span> <span>engineers</span> its user, proportional to that user's dependency upon it.</div>
        <div>observes the space between the production and consumption of technology. Acting rapidly to changes in this space, the <span>Critical Engineer</span> serves to expose moments of imbalance and deception.</div>
